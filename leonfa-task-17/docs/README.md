| Operation (BST) | Time Complexity (worst case) |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| search          | O(n)                         |
| insert          | O(n)                         |
| size            | O(1)                         |
| height          | O(n)                         |
| leaves          | O(n)                         |
| toString        | O(n)                         |

everything but size will have a worst-case of **O(n)** because the tree can act as a singly linked list (elements create a long single branch, either by _ascending_ or _descending_ order.)
