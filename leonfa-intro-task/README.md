# intro-task

Welcome to your first generated DD1337 repo! You can use this repo to complete the computer introduction assignments. We just use this organisation and repo as a sandpit before moving onto the real organisation for your INDA (DD1337, DD1338, DD1396) tasks. Feel free to try out different version control features and once you have completed the basic assignments take a look at this excellent [book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) for more things to try. 

Good luck!
