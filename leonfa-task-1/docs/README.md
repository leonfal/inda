### Exercise 0.1
Two very important things. Attempted the assignment and attend to Ã–vningarna.

### Exercise 0.2

The assignment must at the latest be completed and pushed before the exercise begins. Hypothetical example: if the excercise starts 12:15 on a Friday then the assignment can be pushed until 12:14 on Friday.

### Exercise 0.3
If I am unable to attend, you must contact your assistant as soon as possible. The same goes for if I am unable to submit my assignment in time.

### Exercise 0.4
Yes, the names of classes and objects should be used exactly as they were declared. Java is case sensitive as it is called. It means that the class Car() is not the same as car()

### Exercise 0.5
No it is absolutely forbidden. I am allowed to discuss the assignments with my peers though.

### Exercise 0.6
An example of when it is not ok to copy code from the internet is if it essentially solves the whole task. Another great example is when you don't understand the code that you are copying.

### Exercise 1.31
0 is an int \
"hello" is a String \
101 is an int \
-1 is an int \
true is a boolean \
"33" is a String \
3.1415 is a double

### Exercise 1.32

String name;
```
### Excercise 1.33
```java
send(String);
```
### Exercise 1.34
