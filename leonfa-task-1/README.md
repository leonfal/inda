Welcome to the first assignment for DD1337!

### Read the course instructions!
Before you start working on this assignment, please read through the
**[course instructions](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-21/course-instructions)**
carefully.

**You will need to have read through these to answer exercises 0.x!**

### Deadline
This work should be completed before the exercise, on **Friday 10th September** depending on your group.

### Instructions
For instructions on how to do and submit the assignment, please see the
[assignments section of the course instructions](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-21/course-instructions#assignments).

### Preparation
You must read and answer the questions in the OLI material for Module 1.

- Goto https://kth.oli.cmu.edu/
- Signup as a student with your KTH email address
- Register for the course key `dd1337-ht21`
- Read [Module 1: Introduction to OOP](https://kth.oli.cmu.edu/jcourse/webui/syllabus/module.do?context=881a25adac1f08886e8b1c573ab9ede4)

You may wish to also read from, _Objects First with Java_.

The 4th, 5th and 6th editions of _Objects first with Java_ are all viable to use
for this course, but reading instructions and exercise numbers are only provided
for the 5th and 6th editions. The 4th edition should mostly correspond to the
5th edition. Unless otherwise stated, reading instructions and exercise numbers
are the same for the 5th and 6th editions.

Please commit any written answers to the [`docs`](docs) folder, and commit any
Java code developed to the [`src`](src) folder of your KTH Github repo.
Remember to push to KTH Github.

### Assignment

#### Exercise 0.1
What are the two things you need to do to pass an assignment?

#### Exercise 0.2
When, at the latest, must your assignment be pushed to KTH GitHub? It may be
helpful to use a hypothetical example.

#### Exercise 0.3
What should you do if you know that you are unable to attend an exercise, or
submit the assignments in time?

#### Exercise 0.4
When names/headers of classes and methods are given, should you use them
exactly as they are given? Why or why not? Do uppercase and lowercase
letters matter?

#### Exercise 0.5
Is it okay to copy solutions from another student, if you do it just once in a
while?

#### Exercise 0.6
Give two examples of when it is **not** okay to copy code from the internet.

#### Exercise 1.31
What are the types of the following values?

- 0
- "hello"
- 101
- -1
- true
- "33"
- 3.1415

#### Exercise 1.32
How do you add a new instance variable of type `String` called `name` to a class called `Circle`? Provide a single line of code to illustrate.

#### Exercise 1.33
Write the signature for a method named `send` that has one parameter of type
`String`, and does not return a value.

> **Assistant's note:** If you feel confused about what a method signature
> should look like, you are not alone, because the authors of _Objects First
> with Java_ are too! In the 5th edition, the definition on page 7 is
> **incorrect**. This has been fixed in the 6th edition, but they have left out
> a concrete example and mix it up again later in the book. For the correct
> definition with example, see
> [Defining Methods](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methods.html)
> from Oracle's Java documentation. Both versions will be accepted, but do note
> that it is the one from the Oracle documentation that is actually correct.

#### Exercise 1.34
Write the signature for a method named `average` that has two parameters, both
of type `int`, and returns an `int` value.
